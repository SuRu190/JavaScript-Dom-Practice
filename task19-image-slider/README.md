# Image Slider

## ✅ Objective:
Create an image slider that allows users to navigate through multiple images using Previous and Next buttons.

## 💡 Concepts Practiced:
- DOM manipulation (`getElementById`)
- Event handling with `addEventListener`
- Dynamic image updates
- CSS styling and transitions
- Responsive design using media queries

## 📘 What I Learned:
- How to create a simple image slider using JavaScript.  
- How to dynamically change the `src` attribute of an `<img>` element.  
- How to add smooth fade-in/out transitions between images.  
- How to make the slider responsive on different screen sizes.  
- Handling circular navigation (looping from last to first and vice versa).

## ▶️ Example Flow:
1. Open the webpage → the first image appears in the slider.  
2. Click **Next** → moves to the next image with a smooth fade-in effect.  
3. Click **Previous** → moves to the previous image with fade effect.  
4. The slider loops infinitely: after the last image → returns to the first, and before the first → goes to the last.
