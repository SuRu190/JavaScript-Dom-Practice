## ✅ Objective:
Change the heading text on a button click and revert it back when clicked again.

## 💡 Concepts Practiced:
- DOM selection using `getElementById`
- `textContent` manipulation
- Toggling logic using conditionals
- Button click event

## 📘 What I Learned:

- How to implement toggle functionality with a single button.

## ▶️ Example Flow:
1. Initial heading: “Original Text”
2. Click button → heading becomes: “Hello World!”
3. Click again → heading returns to: “Original Text”
