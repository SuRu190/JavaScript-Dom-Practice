# Dark / Light Toggle Mode

## ✅ Objective:
Create a webpage that allows users to toggle between light and dark modes for specific sections of the page.

## 💡 Concepts Practiced:
- DOM manipulation using `classList.toggle`
- Event handling with `addEventListener`
- CSS transitions and styling
- Responsive design using media queries

## 📘 What I Learned:
- How to switch CSS classes dynamically to implement light and dark modes.  
- How to update button text based on current mode.  
- How to make a webpage responsive across different devices.  
- Structuring sections independently so each side (light/dark) can be toggled separately.

## ▶️ Example Flow:
1. Open the webpage → two sections appear: Light and Dark.  
2. Click **DARK** button on the Light section → section changes to dark mode and button text updates to LIGHT.  
3. Click **LIGHT** button on the Dark section → section changes to light mode and button text updates to DARK.  
4. Resize the browser → layout adjusts for tablets and mobile screens automatically.
